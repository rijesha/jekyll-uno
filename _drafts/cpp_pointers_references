Pointers is a vaiariable that holds memory  address of another variable.
to access the memory location that a pointer points to we can use the * operator.


References A reference variable is an alias. Another name for a variable that already esists. A reference stores the address of an object.

i.e

int i = 3;

//pointer to varaible i
int *ptr = &i;

//A reference for i
int &ref = i;


Pointers can be reassigend.

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int *p;
p =  &x;
p = &y;

references must be assigned at initialization

Create objects on the stack by doing something like
Member m;

Create an object on the heap like
Member* m = new Member();

using the new keywords means you will need to use the delete later on. You will also need the pointer m to delete the object.
If you close the function without a reference or deleting you may cause a memory leak.

Allocating memory on the stack is far faster but is volatile.
